# Trading Consultation, A/B Testing & Testnet API Reference

The **Trading Consultation API** exposes AI Universe as an asynchronous advisory intelligence layer for autonomous trading bots. It provides multi-agent deliberation over quantitative performance metrics, parameter adjustments, drawdown risk assessments, **A/B experimental arm evaluations (Control vs. Treatment)**, and **Testnet Live Environment Safety Safeguards**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Safety Rule & Invariant**: AI Universe is strictly an **advisory system**. It never interacts with exchange endpoints, never holds or signs private keys, and never executes trades. Trading bots independently validate all returned parameter recommendations against hard deterministic safety bounds.

## Architecture Overview

When a trading bot submits performance telemetry, AI Universe convenes a dedicated multi-agent specialist panel:
1. **Trading Analyst (`trading_analyst`)**: Analyzes win rate, profit factor, drawdown curves, and consecutive loss streaks to propose initial parameter calibrations.
2. **Strategist (`strategist`)**: Evaluates trade-offs between capital preservation and trade frequency across active strategies and ensures A/B treatment arms do not diverge excessively from control baselines.
3. **Adversarial Critic (`critic`)**: Challenges curve-fitting risks, small-sample overfitting, and regime shifts.
4. **Data Analyst (`data_analyst`)**: Quantitatively verifies empirical distributions, mathematical significance thresholds, and cross-arm delta statistics.
5. **Synthesizer (`synthesizer`)**: Emits a bounded `AIUniverseDecision` respecting hard constraints.

### Synthesis Decision Rules
- **Maximum 2 parameter adjustments** per decision (prefers 1).
- **Mandatory Quantitative Evidence**: Every adjustment must cite specific telemetry metrics (e.g. *"consecutive_losses=6 justifies tightening stop_loss_pct by 15%"*).
- **Sample Size Gate**: If total closed trades $N < 20$, the system strictly returns `status = "INSUFFICIENT_DATA"`.
- **Healthy Gate**: If win rate $\ge 50\%$, profit factor $\ge 1.25$, and max drawdown $\le 5\%$, the system returns `status = "NO_CHANGE"`.
- **A/B Testing Control Bound**: When consulting for a `TREATMENT` arm with `control_metrics`, adjustments are bounded conservatively ($\le \pm 15\%$) to preserve comparative experimental validity.
- **Testnet Conservative Mode**: When `trading_mode == "TESTNET"`, stop losses are tightened by 10% more than paper simulations (e.g., 20% tightening), position sizing is constrained to $\le 0.8\times$, and dedicated `testnet_risk_assessment` metrics are emitted.
