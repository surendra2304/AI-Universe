# Sentinel Cybersecurity Intelligence & Posture Analysis

AI Universe provides defensive security intelligence and posture analysis for **Sentinel**, supporting automated vulnerability assessment, adversarial attack path reasoning, remediation prioritization, threat intelligence correlation, and dynamic risk scoring.

---

## 1. Primary Analysis Endpoints

- **`POST /v1/sentinel/analyze`**: Executes security posture analysis with multi-agent panels, evidence mapping, and calibrated risk scoring.
- **`GET /v1/sentinel/analyze/{request_id}`**: Retrieves stored security intelligence audit records with full provenance ledger.

---

## 2. Analysis Types & Agent Composition

| Analysis Type | Specialist Agent Composition | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `vulnerability_assessment` | **Security Analyst + Data Analyst** | Evaluates findings, severity distribution, CVSS scores, and exposure context. |
| `attack_path_reasoning` | **Security Analyst + Strategist + Critic** *(Debate Mode)* | Models conceptual exploitation chains and calculates step likelihoods; Critic challenges false-positive paths. |
| `remediation_prioritization` | **Strategist + Security Analyst** | Ranks defensive fixes by risk reduction vs implementation effort (`QUICK_WIN`, `MODERATE`, `SIGNIFICANT_REFACTOR`). |
| `threat_intel_correlation` | **Researcher + Data Analyst** | Maps CVE matches against active in-the-wild exploitation and MITRE ATT&CK tactics. |
| `risk_scoring` | **Data Analyst + Critic** | Generates weighted $[0.0, 10.0]$ overall risk scores calibrated against target asset exposure level. |

## 4. Consumer Isolation & Rate Limiting

- **Rate Limit**: $100\text{ reqs/hour}$ dedicated quota for the `sentinel` consumer API key.
- **Dedicated Queue**: Security intelligence workloads execute independently without blocking or being blocked by FORGE or Trading Bot traffic.
- **Deduplication & Idempotency**: 5-minute deduplication window keyed on `request_id`.
