# Cross-Market & Cross-Asset Intelligence Architecture

AI Universe delivers unified multi-exchange market data, cross-asset correlation modeling, macro regime intelligence, and venue liquidity scoring.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Advisory Invariant**: AI Universe remains purely an advisory intelligence layer. It NEVER signs transactions, NEVER touches private keys, and NEVER executes live market orders.
