# Advanced Intelligence Capabilities & Multi-Modal Reasoning

AI Universe supports multi-modal ingestion, temporal sequence reasoning, counterfactual what-if simulations, tailored audience explanations, and confidence interval estimation.

## 1. Multi-Modal Ingestion Matrix

- `POST /v1/intelligence/multimodal`
- **Supported Formats**:
  - **Text**: Natural language requirements & documents.
  - **Code**: AST syntax-checked source code.
  - **Structured Data**: JSON & CSV telemetry tables with automated row/feature extraction.
  - **URLs**: Target endpoints fetched and parsed for synthesis.
  - **Images**: Vision-capable providers with automatic metadata and OCR extraction fallback.

## 2. Temporal & Counterfactual Reasoning Engines

- **Temporal Reasoning** ([`app/intelligence/temporal.py`](file:///d:/AI%20Universe/app/intelligence/temporal.py)):
  - Evaluates time series data to detect trends (`UPWARD`, `DOWNWARD`, `STABLE`, `VOLATILE`), seasonality, and changepoints.
  - Enforces temporal consistency: prevents contradictory recommendations across time without explicit justification.
- **Counterfactual Reasoning** ([`app/intelligence/counterfactual.py`](file:///d:/AI%20Universe/app/intelligence/counterfactual.py)):
  - Runs what-if simulations based on historical StrategyBank outcome data.
  - Deliberately widens confidence intervals ($95\%$ CI) to reflect counterfactual uncertainty.

## 3. Explanation Generation & Confidence Interval Reporting

- **Tailored Audience Tiers** ([`app/intelligence/explanations.py`](file:///d:/AI%20Universe/app/intelligence/explanations.py)):
  - **Brief**: Single-sentence high-level executive verdict.
  - **Standard**: Contextual paragraph with key evidence citations.
  - **Detailed**: Comprehensive audit trail citing evidence reference IDs and agent dissent.
- **Confidence Interval (95% CI)**: Always accompanies point estimates (e.g. *Conversion expected +12.0% (95% CI: +5.0% to +19.0%)*).
